# Hi this is just a test
To check current director use os.getcwd()

Sundays have to be changed to saturdays as yfinance knows to automatically change saturdays to friday data, but it will be unable to get any data if it is sunday and will output error

yfinance is in local currency
what time do I implement? it has to be when all markets close
